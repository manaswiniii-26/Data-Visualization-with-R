# Data-Visualization-with-R

Project Overview ðŸ“Š

The notebooks in this repository explore the creation and customization of barplots and histograms using base R and common R packages. The aim is to provide clear, commented code examples that are easy to understand and adapt for your own data.

Key Visualizations Included:

Simple Barplots: Basic bar charts to compare categorical data.

Customized Barplots: Barplots with custom colors, labels, and titles.

Side-by-Side Bar Charts: Comparing multiple categorical groups.

Stacked Bar Charts: Visualizing parts of a whole across different categories.

Histograms: Creating and customizing histograms to show the distribution of continuous data.
